# Objectives
1. Foster transparent communitcation with citizens, delegates, and candidates.
2. Cooperate in researching the relevant political offices, candidates, and issues.
3. Organize ourselves locally in order to develop self-reliance and cohesion.

By creating and contributing to this project we intend enable delegates and citizens of the 45th precinct to find and publish information relevant to our community this election year. However, more important than party victories is assuring that our neighborhood is adequately organized and represented.

# How to use this website

We hope that this website provides valuable information about political candidates as well as the ideas and concerns of our community members. We plan to achieve this with community sourced profiles on the candidates and a transparent and accessible means to leverage the interactions our precinct delegates are having with candidates.

### Community Questions & Comments
We will be using GitGub and Google Forms to facilitate community comments and questions. Not only will this make it easier for you to transparently communicate with and through our delegates, but it will allow for full transparency and hopefully reduce redundant work.

If relevant, please include to which candidate or public office you'd like to direct your question or comment.

#### Submitting with GitHub

In order to submit questions with GitHub all you need to do is [create an issue](https://github.com/utahCountyP45/utahCountyP45.github.io/issues).
![github issue](img/githubIssue.png)

This requires you to create a free github account if you don't already have one. If you plan on being a regular participant or contributor with this project we suggest that you go ahead and create this account. It will enable to stay up to date with the project.

#### Submitting with Google Forms
If you'd rather not create a GitHub account you can fill out [this google form](https://goo.gl/forms/ges6rKQ7yXKwRCXU2), which will automatically create an issue. Only your name, subject, and content will be posted to GitHub.

### Candidate profiles
We want to provide profiles for all candidates (federal, state, county, and city) that will be on the ballots in our precinct. Again, this information is community sourced with full transparency about who is sourcing the information by using github to manage all contributions, including edits.

We hope members of our community are researching these things and we elected delegates to do exactly that. Why not work on this together?

[Utah County Elections](/Candidates/countyElections.md)

[Provo City Elections](/Candidates/cityElections.md)

#### Contributing Content

The best way to contribute content is through GitHub. Though we can add content from Google Form entries, we won't have a great way of keeping you up to date if there is a question about your content. 

Once signed into Github (and after you've verified your email if you've just signed up) it becomes incredibly easy to contribute. Fore more details please see our wiki.
