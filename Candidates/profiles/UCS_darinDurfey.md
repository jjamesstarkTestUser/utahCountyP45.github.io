## Summary


## In the Media
Darin Durfey has been involved with decreasing recidivism with a program called ChainBreakers while he was working in corrections. This seems to be a primarily religious program.

>"All these guys are our neighbors, and when they get out of jail they're your neighbor, my neighbor, someone else's neighbor," he said. "You want them to return and be a productive member of society and I know they want that too. The objective is hopefully to give them the tools and the resources they need to make that effective change and be more productive." [1]
