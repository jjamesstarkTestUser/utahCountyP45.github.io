# Utah County 45th Precinct Community Assembly Project

### Objectives
1. Foster transparent communitcation with citizens, delegates, and candidates.
2. Cooperate in researching the relevant political offices, candidates, and issues.
3. Organize ourselves locally in order to develop self-reliance and cohesion.

By creating and contributing to this project we intend enable delegates and citizens of the 45th precinct to find and publish information relevant to our community this election year. However, more important than party victories is assuring that our neighborhood is adequately organized and represented.

### Community Comments and Questions
All democracies should strive to represent their citizens beyond all else. This community project takes this as a founding principle and seeks to apply as directly as possible. We will be using GitGub and Google Forms to facilitate community comments and questions. Not only will this make it easier for you to transparently communicate with and through our delegates, but it will allow for full transparency and hopefully reduce redundant work.

If relevant, please include to which candidate or public office you'd like to direct your question or comment. This is an open comment forum. If you're a resident of the 45th precinct we want you to make your ideas heard on whatever you think is a pressing issue in our community this election year or in general. Also, we want to hear your questions and concerns about this project.

#### Submitting with GitHub

### Contributing website Content
GitHub Makes it very easy for you to suggest changes to the content on our website and it does this in a way that is very transparent and democratic. Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/utahCountyP45/utahCountyP45.github.io/wiki) for more information on how this works on GitHub and how we imagine it working in this project. We want to know how you think it should work too!
